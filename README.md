# Io - Flutter Clock

Io is a digital clock built with flutter for the flutter clock challenge 2020. The main design philosophy behind Io is to make a digital clock desgin that feels familiar to the user, rather than a design that feels foreign while keeping the overall visual quality feel futiristic and cool. The animations are all kept subtle, and a survey conducted shows that the respondants felt mesmerized, causing them to keep looking at it for a longer time.
